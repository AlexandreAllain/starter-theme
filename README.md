# Alexandre Allain - Starter Theme

## Requirement

* PHP 7.2
* WP 5.5
* ACF Pro 5.9

For a full PHP 5.6 compatibility, you can downgrade Twig to v1.

## Install

`composer install`

`npm install`

## Use

`npm run dev` : compile assets for production & update theme version

While you're waiting for a script to be created to modify the "starter-theme" mention in all theme files, don't forget to change the address at which the server should be observed in the gulpfile.
